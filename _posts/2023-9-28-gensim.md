In this work, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting LLMs' grounding and coding ability. Our approach has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve a target task, and exploratory generation, wherein LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel complex tasks.
