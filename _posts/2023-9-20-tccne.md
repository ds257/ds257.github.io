This paper investigates the impact of emojis on
user engagement in trolling contexts on social media platforms.
Utilizing a comprehensive dataset collected from Reddit, this
study categorizes emojis by emotional content and popularity to
analyze their effects on comments and upvotes. Findings indicate
that more popular emojis and emojis that convey emotionality significantly enhance user engagement, while excessive or
misplaced informational emojis reduce it. This research offers
critical insights for strategic emoji use to foster positive online
interactions and mitigate trolling, benefiting content moderators
and digital communicators.
