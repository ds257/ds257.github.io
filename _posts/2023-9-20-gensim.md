In this work, we present GenSim, a scalable LLM framework to augment diverse simulation tasks for robotic policy. We investigate finetuning and prompting in both goal-directed and exploratory approaches to generate new simulation task codes. We then leverage the generated tasks for training multitask policies that show stronger generalization capabilities both to new tasks in simulation and real world.
